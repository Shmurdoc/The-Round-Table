# RoundTable / Cohort Capital
## Full Operational, Legal, and System Specification

---

## Executive Summary

**RoundTable** is a revolutionary cooperative project funding and asset operation platform designed to eliminate the systemic risks inherent in traditional investment vehicles. By pooling capital into fixed, transparent cohorts that fund real income-generating assets, RoundTable creates a framework where outcomes—positive or negative—are shared proportionally among all participants.

The platform is built on principles of **radical transparency**, **immutable governance**, and **shared responsibility**. It explicitly rejects liquidity guarantees, speculative positioning, and misleading financial representations that lead to bank-run dynamics and systemic collapse.

---

## 1. Core Philosophy & Purpose

### 1.1 Foundational Principles

**Transparency Above All**: Every transaction, fee, decision, and outcome is publicly auditable within each cohort.

**No Liquidity Illusion**: Members cannot exit positions mid-cycle. This eliminates bank-run scenarios and forces long-term thinking.

**Real Assets Only**: Every cohort funds tangible, income-generating assets or operations—no abstract financial instruments.

**Pro-Rata Outcomes**: All gains and losses are distributed proportionally to capital contribution. No preferential treatment.

**Immutable Rules**: Post-launch governance rules cannot be altered by administrators without supermajority consent.

### 1.2 What RoundTable Is NOT

- Not a bank (no deposits, no withdrawals on demand)
- Not a securities exchange (no trading, no secondary markets)
- Not an investment fund (no guarantees, no liquidity promises)
- Not a lending platform (no debt instruments)

### 1.3 Target Use Cases

- Real estate acquisition and operation
- Equipment leasing (construction, agriculture, transportation)
- Business acquisition and turnaround
- Renewable energy installations
- Intellectual property commercialization

---

## 2. Key Definitions & Terminology

### 2.1 Core Entities

**Member**: A verified, registered participant who has completed KYC/AML verification and agreed to platform terms. Members can participate in multiple cohorts simultaneously.

**Cohort**: A fixed, isolated group of members funding a single project. Each cohort is legally and financially independent with its own accounts, rules, and lifecycle.

**Project**: A specific, real-world income-generating asset or operation. Examples include rental property, excavator leasing, solar installation, or business acquisition.

**Administrator (Admin)**: The entity or individual responsible for executing the project plan, managing assets, reporting, and distributing outcomes. Admins are compensated through transparent fees.

**Platform**: The technical and legal infrastructure enabling cohort creation, capital pooling, reporting, and distribution.

### 2.2 Financial Thresholds

**Minimum Viable Capital (MVC)**: The absolute minimum capital required to execute the project at break-even viability. Below this threshold, the project cannot proceed.

**Ideal Target**: The optimal capital amount that allows full project execution with appropriate risk buffers and operational flexibility.

**Hard Cap**: The maximum capital accepted (typically 120-150% of Ideal Target) to prevent over-capitalization and dilution of returns.

### 2.3 Outcome Terminology

**Gross Revenue**: Total income generated by project assets during the operational period.

**Operating Expenses**: All costs required to maintain and operate the asset (maintenance, insurance, utilities, labor).

**Admin Fee**: Predetermined percentage or fixed amount paid to the administrator for management services.

**Net Outcome**: Final result after all expenses and fees, distributed pro-rata to members.

## 3. Cohort Lifecycle (Expanded)

### 3.1 Phase 1: Project Listing & Disclosure

**Duration**: Open-ended until funding phase begins

**Admin Responsibilities**:
- Prepare comprehensive project prospectus including:
  - Detailed asset description and condition assessment
  - Historical performance data (if applicable)
  - Market analysis and demand projections
  - Detailed budget breakdown (acquisition, improvement, operation)
  - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
  - Exit strategy and timeline
  - Admin qualifications and track record
- Define MVC, Ideal Target, and Hard Cap
- Set cohort class (Utilization, Lease, Resale, Hybrid)
- Establish fee structure (transparent and fixed)
- Disclose all potential conflicts of interest

**Member Actions**:
- Review project documentation
- Submit questions to admin (public Q&A log)
- Conduct independent due diligence
- Express preliminary interest (non-binding)

**Platform Controls**:
- Verify admin credentials and history
- Review documentation completeness
- Ensure regulatory compliance
- Flag risk factors and disclosures

### 3.2 Phase 2: Funding Window

**Duration**: Fixed period (typically 30-90 days)

**Capital Commitment Process**:
1. Member submits binding capital commitment
2. Funds transferred to segregated escrow account
3. Commitment is locked and cannot be withdrawn
4. Real-time funding tracker displays progress toward MVC/Target

**Escrow Requirements**:
- Third-party licensed escrow agent
- Funds held in segregated, interest-bearing account
- Interest accrues to cohort, not platform or admin
- No funds released until validation phase completes

**Dynamic Scenarios**:
- **Under MVC**: Automatic cancellation and full refund (minus minimal escrow fees)
- **MVC to Ideal Target**: Scaled execution (budget adjusted proportionally)
- **Ideal Target to Hard Cap**: Full execution with optimal buffers
- **Above Hard Cap**: Excess capital refunded pro-rata, or by lottery if oversubscribed

### 3.3 Phase 3: Validation & Launch

**Duration**: 5-15 business days

**Validation Checklist**:
- Confirm sufficient capital (≥ MVC)
- Verify all legal documentation complete
- Establish dedicated cohort bank accounts:
  - Deployment Account (capital release)
  - Revenue Account (income collection)
  - Admin Account (fee payments)
- Finalize and publish immutable governance rules
- Assign unique cohort identifier (CID)
- Record all members and capital contributions on blockchain or immutable ledger

**Launch Conditions**:
- All validation criteria met
- Admin posts performance bond (typically 5-10% of MVC)
- Legal structure established (LLC, Trust, or similar)
- Insurance policies activated (liability, asset protection)

**Failure Scenarios**:
- If validation fails, cohort canceled with full refund
- Admin can voluntarily cancel during validation (penalty applies)

### 3.4 Phase 4: Capital Deployment

**Duration**: Varies by project (1-180 days)

**Deployment Rules**:
- Capital released in tranches per approved budget
- Each disbursement requires admin documentation (invoices, receipts, contracts)
- Real-time transaction log visible to all members
- Major variances (>5% of line item) trigger member notification

**Permitted Uses**:
- Asset acquisition
- Capital improvements as disclosed
- Initial operating reserves
- Closing costs and transaction fees
- Insurance premiums
- Admin setup fee (if disclosed)

**Prohibited Uses**:
- Personal expenses
- Undisclosed investments
- Loans to admin or related parties
- Speculative instruments

**Deployment Completion**:
- Admin submits final deployment report
- Independent verification (for cohorts >$500K)
- Asset formally transferred to cohort legal entity
- Operational phase begins

### 3.5 Phase 5: Operations & Income Generation

**Duration**: As defined in project plan (6 months - 10 years typical)

**Ongoing Operations**:
- Asset operated per disclosed plan (lease, utilization, resale prep)
- All income deposited directly to Revenue Account
- Operating expenses paid from Revenue Account with documentation
- Admin fees paid per schedule (monthly, quarterly, or at exit)

**Reporting Requirements**:
- **Monthly Financial Report**: Income statement, expense detail, cash position
- **Quarterly Operational Report**: Asset condition, utilization metrics, market updates
- **Annual Comprehensive Report**: Audited financials (for cohorts >$1M), revaluation, risk assessment

**Income Distribution**:
- **Option A - Accumulation**: All net income retained until exit (compound growth)
- **Option B - Periodic Distribution**: Quarterly or annual distribution to members (fixed in governance)
- Distributions always pro-rata to capital contribution

**Member Monitoring**:
- 24/7 access to cohort dashboard
- Real-time financial data
- Document repository
- Communication channel with admin (logged publicly)
- Member voting portal (for governance decisions)

**Admin Performance Metrics**:
- Target vs. actual income
- Expense management efficiency
- Response time to member inquiries
- Reporting compliance rate

### 3.6 Phase 6: Exit & Outcome Distribution

**Duration**: 30-180 days

**Exit Triggers**:
- Predetermined timeline reached
- Asset sold per original plan
- Extraordinary event (disaster, condemnation, force majeure)
- Supermajority member vote (75%+)

**Exit Process**:
1. Asset marketed and sold (unless operating transfer)
2. Final expenses settled (closing costs, outstanding liabilities)
3. Net proceeds calculated transparently
4. Outcome distributed pro-rata to members
5. Legal entity dissolved
6. Final report published (public permanent record)

**Outcome Calculation**:
```
Gross Sale Proceeds: $X
+ Accumulated Revenue: $Y
- Total Operating Expenses: $Z
- Admin Fees (cumulative): $A
- Exit Costs (legal, brokerage): $B
= Net Outcome: $N

Member Return = ($N / Total Capital) × Member Capital Contribution
```

**Negative Outcome Handling**:
- If Net Outcome is negative, members lose capital proportionally
- No recourse against admin if plan executed faithfully
- Insurance proceeds (if applicable) distributed pro-rata
- Final report documents causes and lessons learned

**Post-Exit**:
- Cohort marked "Completed" with full performance history
- Data retained permanently for transparency
- Admin performance score updated
- Members can review and rate experience

## 4. Cohort Classes (Expanded)

### 4.1 Utilization Cohorts

**Definition**: Generate income through direct asset usage (rental, service provision)

**Examples**:
- Short-term vacation rental property
- Construction equipment hourly rental
- Commercial kitchen space rental
- Event venue operations

**Income Model**: Usage fees, hourly/daily rates, service charges

**Risk Profile**: Moderate (dependent on utilization rates and market demand)

**Income Model**: Fixed monthly/annual lease payments

**Risk Profile**: Lower (predictable cash flow, longer-term contracts)

**Typical Duration**: 2-10 years

**Key Metrics**: Lease rate vs. market, tenant quality, vacancy periods

### 4.3 Resale Cohorts

**Definition**: Create value through asset appreciation and strategic resale

**Examples**:
- Fix-and-flip real estate

- Domain portfolio acquisition
- Distressed asset rehabilitation

**Income Model**: Capital gain on sale (minimal operational income)

**Risk Profile**: Higher (dependent on market timing and execution quality)

**Typical Duration**: 6 months - 3 years

**Key Metrics**: Purchase price, improvement costs, resale value, market conditions

### 4.4 Hybrid Cohorts

**Definition**: Combine multiple strategies for diversified income

**Examples**:
- Buy-improve-lease-sell real estate
- Equipment lease with residual value resale
- Business acquisition with operational income and exit sale

**Income Model**: Mixed operational income and capital gains

**Risk Profile**: Variable (balanced across multiple revenue streams)

**Typical Duration**: 2-7 years

**Key Metrics**: Multi-dimensional (utilization, lease income, appreciation)

---

## 5. Capital Mechanics (Expanded)

### 5.1 Capital Pooling Rules

**Strict Segregation**: Each cohort maintains separate accounts with zero commingling. Platform operating expenses funded separately.

**Tiered Member Contribution System**:

The platform implements a dynamic, five-tier contribution system aligned with MVC and Target thresholds to ensure broad participation, prevent concentration risk, and optimize cohort capital structure.

**Tier 1 - Starter Members (R3,000 - R10,000)**:
- Entry-level participation for new investors
- Maximum allocation: 15% of cohort MVC
- Access to beginner-friendly cohorts (lower risk profiles)
- Enhanced educational resources and guidance
- Voting weight: Standard (1 vote per R1,000)

**Tier 2 - Active Members (R10,001 - R25,000)**:
- Standard participation tier
- Maximum allocation: 20% of cohort MVC
- Access to all cohort types
- Standard reporting and communication
- Voting weight: Standard (1 vote per R1,000)

**Tier 3 - Committed Members (R25,001 - R50,000)**:
- Serious investors with substantial capital
- Maximum allocation: 25% of cohort MVC or 15% of Target (whichever higher)
- Priority notification for new cohort listings
- Quarterly strategy calls with admins
- Voting weight: Enhanced (1 vote per R900)
- Fee discount: 0.25% reduction on platform fees

**Tier 4 - Core Members (R50,001 - R75,000)**:
- Significant stakeholders
- Maximum allocation: 30% of cohort MVC or 20% of Target (whichever higher)
- Early access to cohort listings (48-hour preview)
- Monthly performance reviews and strategy sessions
- Voting weight: Enhanced (1 vote per R800)
- Fee discount: 0.5% reduction on platform fees
- Option to participate in cohort design feedback

**Tier 5 - Anchor Members (R75,001 - R100,000)**:
- Strategic partners in cohort success
- Maximum allocation: 35% of cohort MVC or 25% of Target (whichever higher)
- Exclusive first-look at premium cohort opportunities
- Direct line to admin team and platform leadership
- Voting weight: Premium (1 vote per R700)
- Fee discount: 1% reduction on platform fees
- Advisory board eligibility for cohort governance
- Participation in platform strategic planning sessions

**Dynamic Allocation Rules**:

1. **MVC-Based Scaling**:
   - For cohorts with MVC < R200,000: Tier caps apply to MVC
   - For cohorts with MVC R200,000 - R500,000: Tier caps apply to average of MVC and Target
   - For cohorts with MVC > R500,000: Tier caps apply to Target

2. **Anti-Concentration Safeguards**:
   - No single member may exceed 35% of total cohort capital at any threshold
   - Combined holdings of top 3 members cannot exceed 60% of cohort capital
   - If thresholds breached, excess automatically allocated via lottery to waitlist

3. **Progressive Commitment Incentives**:
   - Members committing in first 25% of funding window: +2% allocation bonus
   - Members committing to multiple consecutive cohorts: +5% loyalty allocation
   - Members who refer new participants: +3% allocation bonus per active referral

4. **Minimum Diversity Requirement**:
   - Every cohort must have minimum 8 participating members
   - At least 50% of capital must come from Tier 1-3 members (democratization principle)
   - Maximum 3 Anchor Members per cohort

**Aggregate Portfolio Limits**:
- Members can participate in unlimited cohorts simultaneously
- Platform monitors aggregate exposure and provides risk warnings at:
  - 5 concurrent cohorts: Diversification reminder
  - 10 concurrent cohorts: Concentration risk alert
  - 15+ concurrent cohorts: Mandatory risk acknowledgment
- Total platform exposure cap: R5,000,000 per member (regulatory safeguard)

**Capital Call Prohibition**: No additional capital requests after funding phase (except pre-disclosed contingency scenarios with supermajority approval)

### 5.2 Scenario-Based Execution

**Scenario A - Below MVC (Cancellation)**:
- Cohort automatically canceled
- All capital returned within 10 business days
- Members pay pro-rata share of escrow costs (typically <1%)
- Admin receives no compensation
- Learning report published: Why MVC not reached, market feedback analysis

**Scenario B - MVC to Ideal Target (Scaled Execution)**:
- Budget line items scaled proportionally
- Admin presents revised execution plan with tier-adjusted expectations:
  - 60-75% of Target: Reduced scope, extended timeline, adjusted returns
  - 75-90% of Target: Near-full execution with strategic compromises
  - 90-100% of Target: Full execution with minimal buffer
- Members vote to proceed or cancel (majority required)
- If approved, deployment proceeds with adjusted scope
- Member tier benefits maintained regardless of scaled execution
- Example: 75% funding = 75% of planned improvements, return expectations adjusted by dynamic formula

**Dynamic Return Adjustment Formula**:
```
Adjusted Expected Return = Base Return × (Actual Capital / Target Capital)^0.85
Risk Premium Added = +2% for every 10% below Target (compensation for higher execution risk)
```

**Scenario C - Ideal Target to Hard Cap (Optimal Execution)**:
- Full project plan executed
- All budgeted improvements funded
- Optimal operational reserves maintained (15-20% of Target)
- Enhanced risk mitigation strategies fully funded
- Member tier benefits and incentives fully active
- Optimal operational reserves maintained
- Risk mitigation strategies fully funded

**Scenario D - Above Hard Cap (Excess Management)**:
- **Option 1**: Excess refunded pro-rata (default)
- **Option 2**: Lottery system for oversubscribed cohorts (if disclosed)
- **Option 3**: Excess allocated to risk reserve (with higher return expectations)

### 5.3 Capital Deployment Tracking

**Real-Time Ledger**:
- Every dollar tracked from escrow to asset
- Blockchain or immutable database technology
- Public audit trail for all cohort members
- Third-party verification for large cohorts (>$1M)

**Variance Management**:
- ±5% variance allowed within budget categories
- >5% variance triggers member notification
- >15% variance requires member vote to proceed
- All variances documented with justification

---

## 6. Outcome & Distribution Logic (Expanded)

### 6.1 Revenue Accounting

**Revenue Sources**:
- Operational income (rent, usage fees, lease payments)
- Asset appreciation (realized at exit)
- Ancillary income (insurance claims, tax refunds)
- Interest on cash reserves (accrues to cohort)

**Revenue Recognition**:
- Accrual basis accounting for all cohorts
- Monthly reconciliation and reporting
- Independent audit for cohorts >$1M annually

### 6.2 Expense Management

**Operating Expenses** (paid from Revenue Account):
- Direct asset costs (maintenance, utilities, insurance)
- Management overhead (property management, bookkeeping)
- Legal and compliance costs
- Reserve contributions for anticipated repairs

**Admin Fees** (transparent and fixed at launch):
- Setup fee: 2-5% of capital deployed (one-time)
- Management fee: 5-15% of gross revenue (ongoing) OR fixed monthly amount
- Performance fee: 10-20% of profits above hurdle rate (optional)
- Exit fee: Flat amount or percentage of sale proceeds (if disclosed)

**Expense Controls**:
- All expenses >$500 require receipts/invoices
- Annual budgets presented in advance
- Emergency expenses (>$2,000) require member notification
- Admin cannot pay themselves without documentation

### 6.3 Distribution Formulas

**Pro-Rata Share Calculation**:
```
Member Share % = (Member Capital / Total Cohort Capital) × 100

Member Distribution = Net Outcome × Member Share %
```

**Loss Sharing**:
- No member protected from losses
- No capital guarantees or insurance (except disclosed asset insurance)
- Negative outcomes distributed proportionally
- Members acknowledge loss potential in writing

**Timing**:
- Operational distributions: Per governance rules (quarterly, annual, or at exit only)
- Final distribution: Within 30 days of exit completion
- Automatic distribution via ACH/wire to member accounts

### 6.4 Tax Considerations

**Pass-Through Structure**:
- Cohorts structured as pass-through entities (LLC, LP, Trust)
- Income/losses flow to members annually (K-1 or equivalent)
- Members responsible for own tax obligations

**Platform Reporting**:
- Annual tax documents provided to all members
- Compliance with jurisdiction-specific reporting requirements
- Members advised to consult tax professionals

- Material contract amendments

**Non-Votable Matters** (immutable):
- Fee structure (locked at launch)
- Capital distribution formula
- Reporting requirements
- Exit timeline (except by supermajority)

### 7.3 Admin Accountability

**Performance Bond**:
- Admin posts bond (5-10% of MVC) held in escrow
- Forfeit for gross negligence, fraud, or abandonment
- Returned at successful cohort completion

**Removal Conditions**:
- Supermajority member vote (75%)
- Platform-initiated removal (fraud, regulatory violation)
- Admin voluntary resignation (requires replacement plan)

**Replacement Process**:

- Tier 3 (Committed): 20-25% of total capital
- Tier 4 (Core): 10-15% of total capital
- Tier 5 (Anchor): 10-15% of total capital

Diversity Score = (Number of Tiers Represented × 20) + (Member Count × 2) - (Concentration Index × 10)
Minimum Acceptable Diversity Score: 100
```

**Intelligent Allocation Engine**:
- Monitors funding progress in real-time

```
Compatibility = (Risk Tolerance Match × 30) + (Capital Fit × 25) + (Timeline Match × 20) + (Asset Class Preference × 15) + (Admin Track Record × 10)

Score > 80: Highly Recommended (proactive notification)
Score 60-80: Good Match (standard notification)  
Score 40-60: Acceptable Match (available if member searches)
Score < 40: Not Recommended (warning displayed)
```

**Intelligent Waitlist Management**:
- Members on waitlist ranked by:
  1. Tier level (higher tiers get priority when slots open)
  2. Timestamp (earlier expressions of interest prioritized)
  3. Compatibility score (better fits prioritized)
  4. Loyalty status (long-term members rewarded)
- Automatic notification when slot becomes available (15-minute response window)

### 22.6 Performance-Based Tier Evolution

**Member Performance Tracking**:
- Completion rate: % of cohorts completed successfully
- Participation quality: Voting engagement, communication responsiveness
- Diversification discipline: Portfolio balance across cohorts
- Community contribution: Referrals, feedback, forum participation

**Tier Advancement Program**:
- Exceptional members (top 10% performance) can access next tier benefits with 80% of capital requirement

contract CohortEscrow {
    address public admin;
    address public platform;
    uint256 public mvc; // in USD equivalent
    uint256 public target;
    uint256 public hardCap;
    uint256 public fundingDeadline;
    mapping(address => uint256) public memberContributions;
    
    function contribute() external payable {
        // Accept USDT/USDC deposits
        // Track member contributions
        // Check against tier limits
        // Emit ContributionReceived event
    }
    
    function validateAndRelease() external onlyPlatform {
        // Check if MVC reached
        // Release funds to deployment address
        // Or refund if MVC not reached
    }
    
    function distributeFinalOutcome() external onlyAdmin {
        // Calculate pro-rata shares
        // Distribute net outcome to members
        // Burn/close contract
    }
}
```

## 24. Impact Simulator - Predictive Financial Modeling Tool

### 24.1 Purpose & Overview

**Impact Simulator** is an advanced, interactive financial modeling tool that allows members and admins to forecast cohort outcomes, test scenarios, and understand how different variables affect returns. It empowers informed decision-making through data-driven projections.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Pre-investment return projections
- Risk scenario modeling (best/worst/likely cases)
- Sensitivity analysis (variable impact testing)
- Tier benefit comparison
- Crypto volatility impact (if holding crypto)
- Tax implication estimates
- Portfolio diversification analysis

### 24.2 Core Simulation Models

**Model 1: Utilization Cohort Simulator**

**Input Variables**:
- Asset type (vacation rental, equipment rental, etc.)
- Acquisition cost
- Improvement budget
- Daily/hourly rental rate
- Expected utilization rate (%)
- Operating expense ratio (% of revenue)
- Admin fee structure
- Cohort duration (months)
- Member capital contribution amount
- Member tier level

**Output Projections**:
```
Projected Gross Revenue = (Rental Rate × Days/Hours) × Utilization Rate × Duration
Projected Operating Expenses = Gross Revenue × Expense Ratio
Projected Admin Fees = Gross Revenue × Admin Fee %
Projected Net Income = Gross Revenue - Operating Expenses - Admin Fees

Member Return (%) = ((Net Income + Residual Value - Total Investment) / Total Investment) × 100
Annualized Return = Member Return / (Duration in years)
Risk-Adjusted Return = Annualized Return - Risk Premium
```

**Scenario Testing**:
- **Optimistic**: Utilization +20%, Expenses -10%
- **Realistic**: Base case as entered
- **Pessimistic**: Utilization -20%, Expenses +15%
- **Disaster**: Utilization -50%, Major repair cost event

**Model 2: Lease Cohort Simulator**

**Input Variables**:
- Property/asset acquisition cost
- Renovation/improvement budget
- Monthly lease rate
- Vacancy rate (% of time unleased)
- Property management fee (%)
- Maintenance reserve (monthly)
- Property tax & insurance (annual)
- Admin fee structure
- Holding period (years)
- Exit cap rate (for resale value estimation)
- Member capital contribution
- Member tier

**Output Projections**:
```
Annual Gross Rent = Monthly Lease × 12 × (1 - Vacancy Rate)
Annual Operating Costs = Property Management + Maintenance + Tax + Insurance
Annual Net Operating Income (NOI) = Gross Rent - Operating Costs - Admin Fees
Total NOI Over Period = Annual NOI × Holding Period

Estimated Exit Value = (Annual NOI / Exit Cap Rate)
Total Return = (Exit Value + Total NOI - Total Investment) / Total Investment × 100
```

**Model 3: Resale (Flip) Cohort Simulator**

**Input Variables**:
- Purchase price
- Acquisition costs (closing, due diligence)
- Renovation budget (detailed line items)
- Holding costs (property tax, insurance, utilities during renovation)
- Marketing & sales costs (agent commission, staging)
- Target resale price (or use comparable analysis)
- Time to exit (months)
- Admin setup & exit fees
- Member capital contribution
- Member tier

**Output Projections**:
```
Total Investment = Purchase + Acquisition Costs + Renovation + Holding Costs
Gross Proceeds = Resale Price
Net Proceeds = Resale Price - Sales Costs - Admin Exit Fee

Total Return = (Net Proceeds - Total Investment) / Total Investment × 100
Annualized Return = Total Return / (Months / 12)
Member Share = Total Return × (Member Capital / Total Cohort Capital)
```

**Model 4: Hybrid Cohort Simulator**

**Combined Modeling**:
- Phase 1: Improvement period (capital deployment)
- Phase 2: Operational period (lease/utilization income)
- Phase 3: Exit period (resale)
- Comprehensive cash flow modeling across all phases

### 24.3 Advanced Features

**Sensitivity Analysis Dashboard**:

**Variable Impact Testing**:
- Adjust one variable at a time (slider controls)
- Real-time recalculation of returns
- Visual graphs showing impact
- Identify key drivers of success

**Examples**:
- If utilization rate drops from 70% to 60%, return decreases from 18% to 12%
- If exit cap rate increases from 6% to 7%, property value drops R500,000
- If renovation costs overrun by 15%, IRR drops from 22% to 16%

**Monte Carlo Simulation** (Advanced):
- Run 10,000+ random scenarios
- Each variable varies within probability distribution
- Generate probability distribution of outcomes
- Display confidence intervals (50th, 75th, 90th percentile returns)

**Example Output**:
```
50% chance return exceeds: 15%
75% chance return exceeds: 10%
90% chance return exceeds: 5%
10% chance of loss: -8% to 0%
Expected value (mean): 14.2%
Standard deviation: 6.8%
```

**Crypto Volatility Impact Simulator**:

**For Members Holding Crypto Balances**:
- Model impact of crypto price fluctuations on portfolio value
- Scenario testing: BTC/ETH +/-20%, 50%, 100%
- Hedging strategy recommendations
- Optimal crypto allocation (% in stablecoin vs. volatile crypto)

**Example**:
```
Portfolio Composition:
- 30% USDT (stable)
- 40% BTC (volatile)
- 30% ETH (volatile)

Scenario: BTC -30%, ETH -40%
Portfolio Impact: -23% value loss
Recommendation: Increase stablecoin allocation to 60% to reduce volatility
```

### 24.4 Tax Impact Calculator

**Tax Simulation**:
- Estimate capital gains tax (South Africa: 18% inclusion rate)
- Income tax on distributions (marginal rate)
- Timing optimization (hold period impact)
- Tax-loss harvesting opportunities

**Input**:
- Member tax bracket (marginal rate)
- Expected return from cohort
- Holding period
- Other capital gains/losses in portfolio

**Output**:
```
Gross Return: R45,000
Capital Gains Tax (18% inclusion at 45% rate): R3,645
Net After-Tax Return: R41,355
Effective Tax Rate: 8.1%

If held 1 year longer:
- Additional income: R5,000
- Tax on income: R2,250
- Comparison: Higher tax, but higher absolute return
```

### 24.5 Portfolio Diversification Analyzer

**Multi-Cohort Portfolio Simulation**:

**Functionality**:
- Member adds all active/planned cohorts
- Simulator analyzes:
  - Concentration risk (% in single cohort)
  - Asset class diversification
  - Duration diversification
  - Risk score distribution
  - Expected portfolio return (weighted average)
  - Portfolio volatility (standard deviation)

**Optimal Portfolio Recommendations**:
```
Current Portfolio:
- 5 cohorts, R450,000 total exposure
- 60% in real estate, 40% in equipment
- Average risk score: 6.2 (moderate-high)
- Expected portfolio return: 16.5%
